I am also giving the folder structure on git hub and my local computer. I also included main files in backend. remember this.\'a0I will also give the screenshots of UI of the app next . You are an expert in building this app. I will run every update for you and give you feedback and then you should take steps to make it better or correct or modify based on the feedback. Do not go out of context and help me build this for us.\

Prompt - the user should have a soothing experience when he is using the app. his eyes should not be strained. the UI has to be addictive. also I this the User Profile Modal is not properly fitting the contents and not giving a desired UI experience to me. do you think the profile section should be a modal or a page like main page the the user can wish to view at any time. I want to make this into a gamified learning experience to user. Think like an expert designer and suggest\
\
