Prompt - I am attaching a detailed project report of the app we have been building together. It also has frontend and backend folders. right now I am attaching frontend git repository along with it. I am also giving the folder structure on git hub and my local computer. I also included main files in backend. remember this.\'a0I will also give the screenshots of UI of the app next . You are an expert in building this app. I will run every update for you and give you feedback and then you should take steps to make it better or correct or modify based on the feedback. Do not go out of context and help me build this for us.\
\
Prompt - now write me a a-z project report about this app in terms of features, user flows, structure, folder structure, files, so that I can use this report as a complete project context handoff/ transfer to give you the complete context\

Prompt - \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Think correctly. do not loose any of the existing functionality and logic. what ever you want build on top of it\outl0\strokewidth0 \

Go through it, understand it thoroughly and come up with a detailed strategy for features and their implementation for the unique and complete gamification of this app, to become one of the top addictive entertaining learning app.\outl0\strokewidth0 \

Prompt - the user should have a soothing experience when he is using the app. his eyes should not be strained. the UI has to be addictive. also I this the User Profile Modal is not properly fitting the contents and not giving a desired UI experience to me. do you think the profile section should be a modal or a page like main page the the user can wish to view at any time. I want to make this into a gamified learning experience to user. Think like an expert designer and suggest\
\
Prompt- ok it logged in.word generation is working . but the features i gave you with are missing like 1.profile page missing with clickable words under(words explored, favourites and streak history) 2.there are no clickable words in the explaination to click through. the toggle button for favouriting a word is missing.... I am giving the images of previous functionality. correct it perfectly this time without glitches

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \cb4 Prompt - 
\f1 \cf0 \cb1 I want to make the profile modal into a page just like the main app, which the user can click and toggle to. The modal is unable to fit all the details completely. Think correctly. do not loose any of the existing functionality and logic. what ever you want build on top of it. i also gave the screenshoots of my firestone dashboard\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 task - i want to modify the prompt sent to gemini in the backend app.py, to give a desired result. i want to generate an explaination in simple 2 sentences for a word, with clickable subtopics that the user can explore furthe. The prompt should be intelligent enough and well structured that it should select the clickable subtopics from the root word's explaination so that the user is taken into most important concepts, topics that are anyway related to the root word's domain of learning. Plus when the user clicks the subtopic, it should give a simple 2 sentence explaination of the subtopic with clickable words, but in the context of the root word or root word's explaination.\
\
Prompt - give me a explaination in simple 2 sentences for a photosynthesis, with 2 to 3 subtopics from within the photosynthesis explaination ,that the user can select. the subtoics are topics that are anyway related to the photosynthesis domain of learning. The subtopics need to take the user down the rabbit hole of learning everything related to photosynthesis.\
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \strokec2 I want the subtopics to be concise words. for example- Mixture instead of Mixture of Different Things (Understanding Mixtures)\
Components instead of Individual Components (The Goal of Separation)\
Physical Properties instead of Unique Physical Properties (How Separation Works)\
Pure Substances instead of Obtaining Pure Substances (Applications of Separation)\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \strokec2 Prompt - I want these modified such that - 1. there should more intelligence in the context between the primary word and subtopic. 2. there should more intelligence in the contexts between every subtopic 3. the user dives down a rabithole from the primary word down the subtopics in the streak, so make the prompts more intelligent and aware, they have to think like a human, how a human explores anything in real life, for example" we first learn one concept and then learn all the things associated with the primary thing, we become more intelligent as we explore the different aspects of the primary concept and the sub topic and sub\'a0 topic with in subtopic. 4. we are passing the information of all the words the user explored in a streak for the generation of contextually aware explainations for the current word in the streak.5. do not disturb the existing rules and functionality and rules of current prompts. You need to make the prompts aware that they are doing a teacher's job of taking the student down a rabbithole and thereby giving knowledge and IQ. I m also giving the backend file(app.py for logic reference, if you might have anything to say.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \strokec2 Prompt - the loop stopped. but the explain regenerating for contextual or subtopic word explain when toggled between quiz or fact and back to explain.. only explain functionality is regenerating. quiz fact etc are not. I have an idea, evaluate. Since we are making a concept learning game .. what if the user might want to save his contextual word meanings too, other than just a new primary word, can we save every word without just caching in the front end? What if we assign a new tag to the primary word called subject (subject is also fetched by the llm along with the explaination- the prompt should generate the subject along with the explaination, for example if word is photosynthesis, subject is biology, for magnetism - physics, for algebra - math, digestive system - biology, current president of usa - current affairs, louis vitton - lifestyle brand, noun - english, constitution - civics, world war 1 - history, chemical reaction - chemistry, machine learning - computer science etc etc) all these broad subjects that are deduced based on the primary word explaination. and theis subject derived is tagged and stored along with the primary word and all the words in that particular context or streak. I thought of this because, the same word of different subjects wouldnt clash in the database, plus when the user sees his streak history, he could see the subject of the streak and also when he clicks on that particular subject words either primary or subtopics, he should be able to see the subject and the streak context based explaination for the word. also in favourites and all explored words, the words will also have a subject tag , so the user can click on any of the word and go to contextual explaination, as the context / subject is already shown to user. and also we can track which subject is the user more interested and use it for our algorithms later to create more engagement with user subject and word data. what do you think of this idea? do you think we can do something like this at this stage? Im giving current app.py, app.tsx, profilepage. tsx}
